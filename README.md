# SNK DINING HALL MANAGEMENT

## Project Description
SNK HALL DINING MANAGEMENT is a computerized website that aims to deliver a user-friendly, efficient, and convenient dining management system that caters to the needs of both students and administrative authorities of SNK hall of CUET.


While residing in SNK hall, the students have been facing many unsatisfactory services which has caused them great difficulties such as conventional method of dining payment where if the student is absent that day, then the student needs go to the bank to pay the dining fee, the back token needs to be returned physically and if the student has missed to return the back token physically within the given time, then the back token won‚Äôt be counted anymore and the student would lost the money of that day‚Äôs back token, not getting notified about what‚Äôs in the meal beforehand, not having a reliable feedback platform about dining management, lack of interaction between students and managers etc. To address all these issues, a computerized dining management system is badly needed. Hence, this system aims to address all these issues by providing a convenient computerized environment for dining management.

## User types and Characteristics
There are **three** types of users for our system. 

### 1. Admin
Customers interact with our system directly in order to place order, modify order, get bill and give feedback. We do not store any information related to customers in our system. The process of order taking starts from customers placing order and then the other series of events begin.

### 2. Manager
Head Chef can mark a dish as prepared when a chef tells him to do so. He can approve the cancellation of an order whenever a customer edits or removes a dish from his order. He can also assign a dish to a particular chef based on the specialty of the chef.

### 3. Students
Chefs don‚Äôt interact with the system. They just have to look at the dishes present in their queues and prepare the dishes accordingly. Chef‚Äôs name, address and specialty etc. are stored in the database.
