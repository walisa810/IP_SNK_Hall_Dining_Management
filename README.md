# SNK DINING HALL MANAGEMENT

## Project Description
SNK HALL DINING MANAGEMENT is a computerized website that aims to deliver a user-friendly, efficient, and convenient dining management system that caters to the needs of both students and administrative authorities of SNK hall of CUET.


While residing in SNK hall, the students have been facing many unsatisfactory services which has caused them great difficulties such as conventional method of dining payment where if the student is absent that day, then the student needs go to the bank to pay the dining fee, the back token needs to be returned physically and if the student has missed to return the back token physically within the given time, then the back token won‚Äôt be counted anymore and the student would lost the money of that day‚Äôs back token, not getting notified about what‚Äôs in the meal beforehand, not having a reliable feedback platform about dining management, lack of interaction between students and managers etc. To address all these issues, a computerized dining management system is badly needed. Hence, this system aims to address all these issues by providing a convenient computerized environment for dining management.

## User types and Characteristics
There are **three** types of users for our system. 

### 1. Student
Students can log in to check the daily menu, view and manage dining fees, including any applicable late fees, and stay informed about upcoming feasts or special events. They can also track their token return status to ensure no penalties are incurred. This role focuses on providing students with essential dining-related information and payment updates.
### 2. Manager
Managers can set the daily menu, define feast menus, and schedule feast dates. They are responsible for adding extra items and assigning token numbers for both lunch and dinner. Additionally, managers can view and manage all these details in an organized table format, ensuring smooth dining operations.
### 3. Admin
The admin has the authority to add new managers, view the list of current managers, and access detailed student information. This role ensures smooth management of personnel and keeps track of dining operations from a higher level.
